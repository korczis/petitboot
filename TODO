Todo for petitboot (LOTS !):

 * GUI code is still based on the original mockup hack. Needs to be completely
   refactored. We need to define some useable canvas/widget classes in twin and
   use them
 * Add some useable GUI for graphic modes selection and return to GameOS instead
   of the current hacks
 * Rework keyboard handling. twin needs a proper input method support, including
   at least a way to use the kernel keymaps and modifiers key handling. Remove
   some of the keyboard hacks from twin_fbdev and move console switching to
   petitboot
 * Mouse support (twin/petitboot supports it somewhat but it's not working,
   check why, probably an udev issue or missing kernel driver)
 * Saving settings in nvram
   - default boot option
   - default language (when language support is in)
   - video mode (can we read gameos' video settings instead?)
 * uncrappify focus box animation code (do it differently so it doesn't totally
   sucks on the left pane due to the time needed for the alpha blending when the
   box "touches" an icon)
 * Fix issues with yaboot.conf parsing and kboot.conf parsing. Add a proper
   native file format instead of the current hack (or make yaboot.conf native?),
   add icon support to all formats
 * Fixup issues with races vs. udev-helper. Maybe have a global way to keep
   track of present devices, properly make sure add/remove are ordered, etc...
 * Get rid of libm by building libpng without floating point support (and build
   it without write support while at it, to save more space)
 * Define a proper binary format for converted twin fonts and use a proper font
   with multiple language support rather than the stroke font which does US
   ASCII only at the moment
 * i18n support in config files
 * fix title/subtitles "leaking" out of the right side focus box
 * get YDL to fix their config file on their install CD or add a hack to
   recognize it and fix it up

PATCHES WELCOME !
